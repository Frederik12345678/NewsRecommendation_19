IMPORTANT:
- the code assumes that the data lies in a folder called "Data" within the "Project_19" folder. 
- We have chosen to store the data locally since it is too big to share on github.

We have 3 main Notebooks that you can use and look at.
1) Main_pytorch.ipynb
2) Main_tensor.ipynb
3) Final_plots

Most interestingly is (3) final plots. In here we have visualized the results from training all our models and towards the end there is also a table showing the accuracies and other metrics for each model

in (2) Main_pytorch is a notebook that initializes one of our models and trains it. This script can be used to reproduce our results. 

in (3) Main_tensor is the notebook we have used to train the baseline model which was implemented in tensorflow. All of this code is stolen from the code you provided. 

If theres any questions about the code or it does not work please feel free to send a mail to s204213@student.dtu.dk
